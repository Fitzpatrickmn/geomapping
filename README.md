Geological Mapping using Leaflet: 

Using Leaflet, I've created a map reflecting data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 

I've built a new set of tools allowing us to visualize their earthquake data, in hopes that these data visualizations will help better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet.
